   * This gadget builds a chain of XOR gates recursively. Each XOR gate can verify 16 bit at most. If your input elements exceed 16 bit, another XOR gate will be added to the chain.

   * The `length` parameter lets you define how many bits should be compared. `length` is rounded to the nearest multiple of 16, `paddedLength = ceil(length / 16) * 16`, and both input values are constrained to fit into `paddedLength` bits. The output is guaranteed to have at most `paddedLength` bits as well.
   *
   * **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints.
   *
   * It is also important to mention that specifying a smaller `length` allows the verifier to infer the length of the original input data (e.g. smaller than 16 bit if only one XOR gate has been used).
   * A zkApp developer should consider these implications when choosing the `length` parameter and carefully weigh the trade-off between increased amount of constraints and security.
